Installed php-dev and curl as requirements for Twitter module. These will probably be uninstalled when a themable Twitter solution is found.

Ongoing issues with programs carousel. Suspect a JavaScript conflict. Works in Bartik and Bootstrap themes, but not in the Promet theme, which uses a combination of local and Drupal resources.

Promet's CSS classes to show and hide sections based on screen size work, even with views.

Display issue on Campus Resources page is fixed; all I need are images and copy from Steve.

Relevant Counseling, Financial Aid, DSPS, CARE, CALWorks, PLACe, Transfer (not the individual articulation pages), Health, Admin/Student/Instruction offices, Schools, Admissions, Assessment, Honors have all been moved into template and just need minor formatting changes. Staff lists have not been moved due to too many formats. We need a consistent one.

I now find myself seriously hampered by the content migration problem. Nothing works and we need it to work.

No cosmetic changes since 06/01; I have been focused on data migration. Programs, Depts, Degrees, Committees, and people have now been migrated. However, some fields; e.g, contact person, must be updated manually.

Most of the programs and committees' data fields have been cleaned up. A permanent fix for the hero display is proving harder than I thought, but we are now close.

Beginning the process of translating the custom RSS for the mobile app.

If you get that THEMENAME issue when uploading a config, go into the database and in the config table, look for an entry named THEMENAME.settings.yaml. Delete it, and make sure it's not in the tar of the config that you're uploading.

The homepage uses too much memory for the full size screenshot.

Most campus resources have been migrated.

No changes to sites/default/custom.

Mobile menu now works, but still needs work in order to function properly 100% of the time. Still not collapsing quite right, but at least it does something.

The tabs interface for the directory quit working. Probably more than I'm going to be able to fix tonight.

COntinuing to relate programs/degrees. 

GOt the menu more locked down but it still requires tweaks.

More content has been moved. If the tabbed directory doesn't work by cutover, it can easily be made into a two-page solution for now. 

I'm a lot more worried about the mobile menu.

July 5--Got the directory listings imported. Database changes but nothing else to commit at this time.

20170706-11:31:
No template or file changes to commit. Final database and file dump.

Changes that should show up in this dump: 

Directory Listings should all have a Category. Previously missing.

Each Program should now have a contact person. Some were missing. Additionally, some Programs now have a course sequence file. Example: Biology.

Most of today's work was done in the database; nothing further to commit.

20170707:
After an entire day of trying various things, the directory has basic function on a single page. It's not ready for production, as some stylistic aspects must be adjusted. Also, the map display if still required, must be done differently and that will take time.

No further database dumps will be made until requested.

IMPORTANT CONFIG CHANGE

Composer began throwing an error when installing a module: Out of swap spave. Following research, I increased my VM's PHP memory limit to 1792k in /etc/php/php7/apache2/php.ini. This fixed the issue and thus far has caused no other problems.
